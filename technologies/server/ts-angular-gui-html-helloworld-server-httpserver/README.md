* **Server**: A server is a computer or software system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can host websites, manage databases, handle email, and perform other tasks to support multiple clients simultaneously.
* **Http Server**: A JavaScript HTTP server is a server application written in JavaScript that handles HTTP requests and responses.
