DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to connect **front-end** application - basing on **Typescript and Angular** framework - with **back-end** application - basing on **Java and Spring Boot** framework. Connection is done by using **API REST**. 

##### Terminology
Terminology explanation:
* **Java**: object-oriented programming language
* **API REST**: an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data
* **Spring Boot**: framework for Java. It consists of: Spring + Container + Configuration
* **Maven**: tool for build automation
* **Git**: tool for distributed version control
* **Typescript**: it's superset of Javascript. It means that it contains everything like Javascript plus it's strongly typed, it provides OOPS elements etc. 
* **Angular**: it's component-based framework for building structured single page applications on client side. 

##### Flow
The following flow takes place in this project:
1. User via any browser sends request to front-end application for the content.
1. Front-end application sends request to back-end application for content.
1. Back-end application sends back response with content to front-end application.
1. Front-end application sends back response with content to User via browser.
